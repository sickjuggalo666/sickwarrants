## SickWarrants ##

Thanks for using my warrant system! its super simple to use and set up for your server!

Simply add the export into anything you want to trigger it from. Be it from Police Menus or City Halls!

## { exports['sickwarrants']:WarrantMenu() } ##

Make sure to run the sql!

Put `ensure sickwarrants` in server.cfg

And set warrants!

Doesn't do anything except set it be seen in menus! if you want you can use the DB data to pull info for you to use!

## Enjoy!!! ##
